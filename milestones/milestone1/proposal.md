# Proposal:
Our team has multiple project ideas that we would like to explore before deciding on one. For feedback, we have listed all our ideas here:

* **Mapping US political ideology and voter participation rates onto local demographic information**

This mobile web app would use public, government-provided voter data to show trends in voting behavior against demographic/geographic data. For instance, the user could provide a specific district, and the app would give historical trends and changes in political ideology, voting history, and participation rates. This app and the data analysis would be helpful for uncovering multi-dimensional trends that influence politics and society, such as whether living in areas of low or high diversity have an effect on political ideology or voting behavior.

* **Sleep tracking and analysis**

This mobile web app would have the user provide their own sleep data, and be able to optimize and provide recommendations on how to improve sleeping habits. After providing the sleep start and sleep end time, the app would be able to–over time–provide recommendations on how to improve sleep habits. At the end of the week, a report would be generated that summarizes the user’s sleep activity for the past week. This app would be helpful for allowing people to understand their own habits and make incremental improvements in their schedules and sleep behavior.

* **Grade/Class Management**

This mobile web app would have a student user provide their own grade data as well as the instructor's grading structure to allow the student to track their grades over time with more accuracy than traditional grade management tools. This app would not only be a single location that stored real-time and accurate grade information for all classes, but this app would also allow the student to "project" their grade and enter hypothetical data to better plan for future assignments and exams.

* **Productivity Sidekick**

This web app's purpose is to help people be more productive by blocking certain sites for them. Users get to choose which websites they want blocked, for how long, and they can even choose for when they want the blocking to start. It would be nice to also let them choose a time they would want the blocking to automatically start. I was hoping to get feedback on how difficult this may be to do? I have never done something that has to do with blocking sites, is this idea to far fetched for our skill level?

* **Help Smokers Quit**

This web app would be a health tracking app that's purpose is to help smokers quit smoking. It would track important things that are important in terms of helping smokers quit. For example, tracking how much they smoke in a day is important. It would give tips, reminders, etc. More research to be conducted to know what is helpful in terms of quitting and that will be used in the app.

* **NBA Player/Team Analysis**

This web app would take data on each NBA player's shooting percentage as well as team's win percentage when playing different teams. This could help determine whether a player/team performs slightly better or worse when facing a certain team. The benefits of this app would be to inform people that play fantasy basketball or place bets on teams to determine whether that specific person/team perform slightly better or worse than normal.

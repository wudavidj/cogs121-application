## Intelligent recommendations and predictions (Storyboard 1)
In this storyboard, the user (Max) notices that a basketball game will be taking place on Saturday. However, given multiple factors, Max isn't sure on whether he wants to go or not. To have more clarity in making his decision, he consults the app. While using the app, Max not only sees data on the teams/players in Saturday's game, but Max also sees intelligent recommendations on whether the game will be eventful or not. With this information, Max can make a more informed decision on whether to attend the game or not.

## (Storyboard 2)
In this storyboard, the user is playing fantasy basketball and looking at his opponent for the week. He noticed that he currently losing and need to try and switch up his roster in order to be ahead. He has a dilemma as he doesn't know who to play for his last open roster spot. So he decides to use our application and check which player will do better based on past performances against that team. The application makes a prediction for him and he follows through by awarding the predicted player the final roster spot. He sits and enjoys the game to watch his fantasy team play. After the game is over, he noticed that the prediction was right and that between the last two players, the prediction that the application made was the player that performed better and now he is currently winning against his opponent because of that choice.

# Paper Prototypes
## (Paper Prototype 1)
In this prototype we have one design idea that is based on basketball teams as a whole rather than individual players. On the home page the user will be shown, which states are playing currently and then user will be able to click on the one they are interested in. The next page will show important information abut each team. And at the end we will have a prediction about what team we think will win using an algorithm that we will come up with.

## (Paper Prototype 2)
In this prototype we will be more focused on individual players. Users can click on a specific player from the current ranks or they can search their own player. The next page will show important information about the player and then allow the user to search another player and then show stats about the two players side by side.

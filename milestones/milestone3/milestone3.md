# Written Explanation
For our home page, we merged our two paper prototypes and incorporated the ideas into one, more unified approach. We banked more on Prototype 2's approach, but we wanted to also add the Google Maps from Prototype 1 into our UI skeleton.

For our player page, we stuck very close to the format of our Prototype 2 because we felt like it effectively and efficiently communicated information that was most relevant to the user. While we will continue to refine the design, our UI skeleton contains most of the major features that we would like to have within the players page.

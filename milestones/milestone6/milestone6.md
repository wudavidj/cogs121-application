# UI Skeleton Written Explanation
On the whole, our user interface design work this week focused primarily on three areas. We focused and improved our design in terms of consistency, visual design, and functionality. In terms of consistency in our design, we worked to ensure that all pages looked similar and used similar layouts. In terms of visual design, we worked to improve color coordination/choice and typography issues. We made sure that typography was appropriately sized and spaced out. In terms of functionality, we worked to ensure that all our stylesheets were properly formatted and produced accurate designs on the front-end. We also made sure that our interface was responsive for all screen sizes and resolutions.

# Data Visualization Written Explanation
## Data Visualization 1
For our first data visualization, we are going to be displaying information about a player's field goal percentage. We are going to be using a heat map that will help show the player's field goal percentage for each quarter and include another variable which is how much time is left within each quarter. We thought that using a heat map will help users visualize which quarter does the player perform the best or worst at.

## Data Visualization 2
Our second data visualization focused on displaying information relevant for teams. We decided to implement a graph in the form of a line chart that displayed the team's "success" over time. Once the user selects a team (at the top of the page, in the input field), the graph will be populated with historical data on that team's win ratio. After every game played by that team, a ratio of wins:total games played is calculated and mapped on the graph.

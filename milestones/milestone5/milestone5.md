# Written Explanation
Our user interface has improved over milestone4.md. For one, we have started using Bootstrap as our design framework instead of using our own CSS design elements. That way, we can better standardize our design elements, design around responsiveness screen sizes, and have reusable controls. We also added features for better navigation, such as a navigation bar at the top. We also improved upon visual design elements, particularly with controls such as buttons.

We also created and designed a new "Prediction" page, which allows users to take two teams and "simulate" a game between the two. We decided to also display the Top 10 teams in 5 simulated games, and then have input fields at the bottom to have the user put in their own team pair.

# Non-Trivial Actions
## User Action 1
Our first User Action is to have the user find a player and find out their player history and statistics. This will be done by navigating to the "Players" page via the navigation bar on the top. The user will then search for their player of choice (i.e. Kevin Durant) and identify key elements of the player's "profile." The user can also, if they wish, add another player in order to compare two player's statistics. This comparison can be done at the bottom of the page, where the user can add another player's name in the input field (i.e Stephen Curry).

## User Action 2
Our second User Action is to have the user determine predicted winners of a game with two teams of their choice. To do so, the user will first navigate to the "Predict" page via the navigation bar on the top. Then, they will add two separate teams they would like to "simulate" a game with by putting in their team names at the bottom (i.e. OKC and HOU). After adding the teams, they will be able to see the predicted winner of the two teams they selected.

## Neda Khanverdi

## David Wu
When starting this project, I contributed by providing suggestions on application ideas. In addition, I worked on milestones and provided feedback and suggestions on features/interactions to add into our application. In terms of design, I contributed by creating interface mockups and facilitating in our design-decisions process. I also contributed to development by coding mainly front-end code and some visualizations.

## /public/routes/index.js

## /public/routes/player.js
/player.js is our .js file that corresponds with /player.handlebars. It allows the user to see the page and have content loaded on that page.

## /public/routes/team.js
/team.js is our .js file that corresponds with /team.handlebars. It allows the user to see the page and have content loaded on that page.

## /public/routes/prediction.js

## /public/views/index.handlebars

## /public/views/player.handlebars
/player.handlebars is the main page for displaying player information, comparing players, and our data visualization for players. To implement this page, we used Javascript code on both /player.handlebars as well as in corresponding AJAX calls in /app.js to grab information from our back-end database. From this, we were able to populate the player information on the front-end.

## /public/views/prediction.handlebars

## /public/views/team.handlebars
/player.handlebars is the main page for displaying team information, comparing team, and our data visualization for teams. To implement this page, we used Javascript code on both /team.handlebars as well as in corresponding AJAX calls in /app.js to grab information from our back-end database. From this, we were able to populate the team information on the front-end.

## /app.js

## /games.db

## /gamestatus.csv
/gamestatus.csv is our back-end .csv file/database that is used exclusively for our data visualization for teams. It contains games played and the win/loss status of each team. This allows the algorithm on our front-end to determine win percentages for each time when the user wants to see that information on the front-end.
